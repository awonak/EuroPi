# Contributions

If you have written a program that you would like to share to the community, please feel free to submit a Pull Request.  
To do this, you'll need to fork this repository to your own page, upload your program to the contrib folder, and then submit a request to merge your fork back into this repository.
  
### Submission Format
Please include:
- Your name (or username) and the date you uploaded the program (dd/mm/yy) as a comment at the top of the file
- Either a description as a comment at the top of the code itself if the program is very simple/obvious, or as a file with the exact same name as the program but with the '.md' suffix. It's much preferred to always have an 'md' file rather than a comment, as it's a much nicer way to view the program's function and a place for you to explain how the inputs and outputs are used.

### File Naming
Please use all lowercase and separate words with underscores for your program names.
e.g. the files associated with a program for a Sample and Hold function would look as follows:  
  
**sample_and_hold.py  
sample_and_hold.md**

### If you are unsure
Take a look at other submitted programs to see how to format yours if you are unsure, and feel free to send me any questions at either [contact@allensynthesis.co.uk](mailto:contact@allensynthesis.co.uk)
